r"""**Knapsack problem**.

This module implements the Knapsack problem.

In its simplest form, it states that:

    *Given a set of items, each with a given weight and value,
    determine the number of each item to include in a collection
    so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given weight capacity
    and the total value is as large as possible.*

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \text{maximize the total knapsack value } & \sum_{i=1}^{n} value_i * x_i \\
   \text{with respect to the design variables }&x_i \\
   \text{subject to the general constraints }
   & \sum_{i=1}^{n} weight_i * x_i \leq capacity_weight\\
   & \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq capacity_items\\
   \text{subject to the search domain }
   & x_i \in \mathbb{N}
   \end{aligned}

Multiple variations of the Knapsack problem can be achieved
depending on the inputs provided.

Moreover, a multi-objective version of this problem is also available,
in which the following new objective function is added to previous formulation:

.. math::

   \text{minimize the number of items carried } & \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i

    """Generic knapsack optimization problem.

    Different `variations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_knapsack_problems>`_
    can be achieved:

    - 0/1 or Binary Knapsack problem:

        Given a set of :math:`n` items, each with a weight :math:`w_i` and
        a value :math:`v_i`, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity :math:`W`.
        Choose which items to pack in order to maximize the total knapsack value
        while respecting its weight capacity.

    - Unbounded Knapsack problem:

        With respect to the Binary variant, it removes the restriction that there is
        only one of each item. This can be achieved by setting the attribute
        :attr:`.binary` to False, which will remove the upper bound of the
        design variables.

    - Bounded Knapsack problem:

        With respect to the Binary variant, it specifies an upper bound for each item.
        This can be achieved by providing an array :attr:`.items_ub` with the upper
        bound relative to each item.

    Moreover, an additional constraint regarding the total number of items can be added.
    This is achieved through the attribute :attr:`.capacity_items` and will limit
    the number of items that fit into the knapsack.
